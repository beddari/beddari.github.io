      <description>Depending on your interest and investments in the various local pubs and bars last night you might be a bit tired. Relax, there are no choices to be made until after the keynote so be early to secure your front row seat!

      <description>Originally cfgmgmtcamp was a single track conference and although aspects of that still remains in 2019 the organizers have taken a liberal approach to adding more tracks. This is awesome but it really makes it challenging to get an overview of what is happening.

Do not stay where you think you belong!</description>
